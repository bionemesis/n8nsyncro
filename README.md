n8n workflows that integrate with Syncro

These are workflows that we created for our MSP to work with Syncro's API. They are provided as is without any support. When working with the Syncro API, you need to use Authorization type "Header Auth" and use "Authorization" for the Name and "Bearer <token>" for the Value (chaning <token> to your API key).
